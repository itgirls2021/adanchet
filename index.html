    Hello everyone! I'm Alexina Ancheta, but you may call me Lexine. I am a rising senior and I'm from 
    the Philippines. I joined this course because I wanted to explore other fields and do things that
    I never imagined myself doing. I actually have not much knowledge in the advancements 
    of technology and I wanted to learn more about it since it is the one that shapes our world today. 
    I am particularly interested in science and medicine, so technology would be a perfect match! 
    
    For my interests, I play the flute, piano, violon, and cello. I also play a couple of sports such
    as basketball, football, and badminton. I especially enjoy reading science books. I love adventures
    as I get to discover new things.

    I really look forward to learning more about technology and getting to meet new people. :)
