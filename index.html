    <h1>Alexina's Interests</h1>
<p>
    Hello everyone! I'm Alexina Ancheta, but you may call me Lexine.
</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    I am a rising senior and I'm from the Philippines. <strong>I joined this course because I wanted 
    to explore other fields that I never imagined myself doing.</strong> I actually have not much knowledge in 
    the advancements of technology and I wanted to learn more about it since it is the one that shapes 
    our world today. I am particularly interested in science and medicine, so technology would be a
    perfect match! 
</p>
<p>
    For my interests, I play the flute, piano, violin, and cello. I also play several sports such
    as basketball, football, and badminton. I especially enjoy reading science books. I love adventures
    as I get to discover new things.
</p>
<p>
    I really look forward to learning more about technology and getting to meet new people. :)
