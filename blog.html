        <h1>Game Challenge</h1>

        <h2>Doors of Destiny</h2>
        <p>Alexina Ancheta / August 3, 2021</p>

        <p>I together with five other IT Girls designed an app that would teach teens how income
            inequality could impact their ability to learn in school. We decided to name our company
            MTSLD which are the initals of our names. Our game is called Doors of Destiny as the 
            players immerses into different scenarios as they enter different doors.
        </p>
        <p>New players start from the basic level and move up as they accomplish specific tasks.
           They would start by exploring a small town, then a city, a country, until they reach the 
           worldwide stage. The modes of transportation, features, and priveleges also upgrade as they
           move up through the levels. Tasks to be completed are not limited to but include, earning
           a specific number of coins or doing some jobs. Participants will get to try out different
           jobs and they will earn salary as they complete the activity. All types of jobs such as 
           full time jobs, part time jobs, contracts, and work from home are included.You will also 
           learn how to start and run your own business. They will also get to see the different
           prices of items such as utilities, food, rent, and clothes among many others so that they
           will get a feel of how easy or difficult it would be to get their necessities. Once they get
           to the worldwide level, they will start to exchange their money to different currencies as
           they travel from one country to another. There will also be charities and organizations
           where they can donate their hard-earned money and earn points!The game is interactive as they
           get to meet people and discover what they do for a living. There will be graphs and charts 
           that they can analyze. Reports will be sent to them to show you how well they have done on that 
           level so that you they reflect on what they can improve on as they move through the game. 
        </p>
        <p>
           This game will give you a better understanding of what people do and you will better
           appreciate their hardwork. Aside from the financial aspect of the game, you will also get to
           learn how to do the different jobs and what skills and equipment are required.
           This game is very engaging and educational. You can travel to different places and 
           experience new things in just a single app! It suits peole of all ages and from all walks
           of life, but it is specially designed for high school students to prepare them for
           the future that awaits them. It will prepare them for the real world as they move on to 
           college and have their own job as well. Hopefully, you'll be able to apply the techiniques
           to real life situations. This stimulation gives you an advantage to help you become
           successful as you get to practice real life skills.

        <h1>Machine Learning Influence on Us</h1>

        <h2>How Machine Learning Might Influence Our Decisions</h2>
        <p>Alexina Ancheta / July 23, 2021</p>
        <p>
            I remember the day I first started listening to music on You Tube. I had no history or any
            searches. It offered me the most popular songs or songs with the most number of views or likes.
            However, I have song preferences and so I searched them up. I listened to several of them and
            my history started to get longer.
        </p>
        <p>   
            The next time I opened You Tube, I was surprised to see that it was recommending me to 
            listen to the songs I listened to last time. When I clicked the "search" bar, the songs I 
            searched previously were collected. That's when I realized that it was using memory and data
            to give me recommendations. As I started "liking" songs, apparently it also collects That
            information and uses it to decide which songs are of interest to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel that it is a bit of unfair because it does not really know much about me. It is just
            guessing based on my previous actions and most likely comparing me to what others do. It usually
            wants me to repeat previous actions or similar to those. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that it should collect more information about me before suggesting those songs. It could
            ask me to fill out a questionnaire about my interests. After each song is played, it can also ask
            me how I felt after hearing the song (happy, sad, touched, angry...). Through this, it can get to 
            know more about me and suggest songs that fit me more. Once I open the app, it can also ask me how
            what my mood is and what I feel like listening to. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In class, we used Teachable Machines to detect whether or not the computer recognizes
            the difference between me alone and me holding Otto. Our group went for this because we 
            just thought that having a Syracuse themed actvity was cool! It worked well and the 
            computer was able to correctly identify whetner or not I was holding Otto.

        <h1>Cryptography In Our World Today</h1>
        
        <h2>We Are Made Up of Codes<h/2>
        <p>Alexina Ancheta / July 22, 2021</p>
        <p>
            Believe it or not, we are all made up of codes! Our DNA contains the instructions needed for
            an organism to live. DNA sequences are converted into messages that are used to produce proteins.
            These proteins are responsible for keeping us alive and moving. They also fight off bacteria and
            viruses. Through these, we are able to enjoy the beauty that lies beneath everything. We are able
            to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. Only the cells that require the specific instructions are able
            to decode it to be able to perform its task. In that way, our systems are organized and each organ
            can focus on its purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptography is everywhere! It is used in all types of fields. It helps us to learn, provides
            us with the latest information, keeps us healthy, lets us communicate, and brings us to other
            places among others. We may not be aware, but it is there. It is behind almost anything you can 
            think of. It is used in food manufacturing, medicines, architecture, airplanes, cellphones, gadgets,
            agriculture, and many more!
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, cryptography helps me to accomplish my goals. It is part of my life and will always be.
            From the day I was born, cryptography was already there to help me survive. In the operating 
            room, a lot of machines with codes were used to cut through my mother's stomach and there came I.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptography keeps me safe. It protects me and lets me be who I am.
