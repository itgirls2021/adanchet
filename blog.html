        <h1>Cryptography In Our World Today</h1>
        
        <h2>We Are Made Up of Codes<h/2>

            Believe it or not, we are all made up of codes! Our DNA contains the instructions needed for
            an organism to live. DNA sequences are converted into messages that are used to produce proteins.
            These proteins are responsible for keeping us alive and moving. They also fight off bacteria and
            viruses. Through these, we are able to enjoy the beauty that lies beneath everything. We are able
            to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. Only the cells that require the specific instructions are able
            to decode it to be able to perform its task. In that way, our systems are organized and each organ
            can focus on its purpose.

            Cryptography is everywhere! It is used in all types of fields. It helps us to learn, provides
            us with the latest information, keeps us healthy, lets us communicate, and brings us to other
            places among others. We may not be aware, but it is there. It is behind almost anything you can 
            think of. It is used in food manufacturing, medicines, architecture, airplanes, cellphones, gadgets,
            agriculture, and many more!

            For me, cryptography helps me to accomplish my goals. It is part of my life and will always be.
            From the day I was born, cryptography was already there to help me survive. In the operating 
            room, a lot of machines with codes were used to cut through my mother's stomach and there came I.

            Cryptography keeps me safe. It protects me and lets me be who I am.
